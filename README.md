## **Predicting Employee Attrition**

**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. We utilized a dataset containing information about employee satisfaction, performance, workload, and other relevant factors. By building and evaluating various models, we identified key factors influencing employee turnover and provided actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

**Business Understanding**
The primary goal of this project is to assist organizations in understanding and mitigating employee attrition. High turnover rates can lead to increased recruitment and training costs, decreased productivity, and a negative impact on company culture. By accurately predicting employee attrition, organizations can proactively implement strategies to retain valuable talent.

**Data Understanding**
The dataset used in this project contains information about various employee attributes, including:

* **Satisfaction Level:** Employee's self-reported satisfaction level.
* **Last Evaluation:** Score of the employee's last performance review.
* **Number of Projects:** Number of projects the employee is currently working on.
* **Average Monthly Hours:** Average number of hours worked per month.
* **Time Spend Company:** Number of years the employee has been with the company.
* **Work Accident:** Whether the employee has had a work accident.
* **Left:** The target variable indicating whether the employee left the company (1) or stayed (0).
* **Promotion Last 5 Years:** Whether the employee was promoted in the last 5 years.
* **Department:** The department the employee belongs to.
* **Salary:** The salary level of the employee (low, medium, high).

**Modeling and Evaluation**

Several machine learning models were employed to predict employee attrition:

1. **Logistic Regression:**
   * A statistical model that predicts the probability of an event occurring.
   * While not as powerful as ensemble methods, it provides a baseline and is interpretable.

2. **Decision Tree:**
   * A tree-based model that makes decisions based on a series of rules.
   * It's interpretable and can handle both numerical and categorical data.

3. **Random Forest:**
   * An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

4. **XGBoost:**
   * A powerful ensemble method known for its efficient implementation and high performance.

The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

**Conclusion**

The Random Forest and XGBoost models demonstrated superior performance in predicting employee attrition. Key factors influencing attrition include:

* **Job Satisfaction:** Employees with lower satisfaction levels are more likely to leave.
* **Workload:** Excessive workload can lead to burnout and attrition.
* **Promotions and Recognition:** Lack of opportunities for growth and recognition can negatively impact retention.
* **Tenure:** Employees with shorter tenures may be more prone to leaving.

To improve employee retention, organizations should prioritize employee satisfaction, manage workloads effectively, provide opportunities for growth and development, and implement targeted retention strategies.

**Future Work**

* **Feature Engineering:** Explore creating new features that might improve model performance, such as combining multiple features or creating interaction terms.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search.
* **Ensemble Methods:** Experiment with other ensemble techniques, such as AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Analyze time-series data to identify trends and seasonal patterns in attrition rates.
* **Explainable AI:** Use techniques to interpret the model's decisions and understand the underlying reasons for predictions.
